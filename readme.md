# Dotfiles
My preferences for zsh, git, Textmate 2 and
[JSLintMate](https://github.com/rondevera/jslintmate). Incorporates
[z](https://github.com/rupa/z).

Clone the repo into `~/.dotfiles` and run:

    sh ~/.dotfiles/install.sh

This will symlink everything into the home directory.

Put zsh stuff that shouldn't be shared into `zsh/secret.zsh`
