# Dotfiles

My preferences for zsh, git, vscode and vim.

Also:

- [z](https://github.com/rupa/z)
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com)
- [direnv](http://direnv.net/)
- [pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure)

Clone the repo into `~/.dotfiles` and run:

    cd ~/.dotfiles && make

This will symlink everything into the home directory.

Put zsh stuff that shouldn't be shared into `zsh/secret.zsh`
