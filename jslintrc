# Options files live in your home directory or project repository, and can be
# written in JSON or YAML. They can be used not just by JSLintMate, but also by
# teammates' lint tools in other editors, continuous integration systems,
# automated testing systems, and more. This is great for helping your team use
# the same coding standards everywhere.
#
# To use this file, save a copy as `~/.jslintrc`. JSLintMate reads JSLint
# options from this path by default, and detects whether it contains JSON or
# YAML. If you want to change this path:
#
#     1.  Save a copy of this file where you'd like it. For example:
#
#           * If you want to keep a personal set of options, save it outside
#             of your project's directory, e.g., `~/Documents/jslint.json`.
#           * If you want to share an options file with project collaborators,
#             save it in your project's directory, e.g., `config/jslint.json`.
#
#     2.  In TextMate's "Bundles" menu, select "Bundle Editor" >
#         "Show Bundle Editor" > "JavaScript JSLintMate" > "Options Files".
#
#     3.  Change the value for `TM_JSLINTMATE_JSLINT_OPTIONS_FILE` to the path
#         for your options file.
#
#         If your options file is within your project, the value should start
#         with the variable `$TM_PROJECT_DIRECTORY`, e.g.,
#         `$TM_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/config/jslint.json`.
#
#     4.  Close the "Bundle Editor" window.
#
# Tweak the options in your new options file, and you're done!
